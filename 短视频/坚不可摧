短视频:坚不可摧

我没有什么所谓的野心，不贪权不恋财不迷色（喜欢肯定是喜欢的，这辈子都会喜欢，只是这些对  
我来说并非最重要）  
有句话很形象我现在的感受，“我啊，我只是想证明。这样的我，就算这样的我，也有能够靠自己的  
双手争取到的东西”

大学毕业对我来说可能就会是一个起点吧，探索人生的真正起点，大四保研后，我希望取研究哲学、  
历史、etc。想要探寻一下我活着的意义、我的三观等等问题。  

我觉得视频中的那句话很激励我：
	Most people give up on themself easily.
	You know the human spirit is powerful?
	There is nothing powerful, it's hard to kill the human spirit. 
	Anybody can feel good when they have their health, their bills, are paid,  
     they have happy relationships. Anybody can be postive then. Anybody can have  
     a larger vision then. Anybody can have faith under those kinds of circumstances.  
	The real challenge of growth mentally, emotionally and spiritually comes when  
     you get knocked down.  
        It takes courage to act.
	Part of being hungry when you have been defeated.  
	It takes courage to start over again.  
	
	Fear kills dreams.
	Fear kills hope.
	Fear put people in the hospital.  
	Fear can age you.  
	Can hold you back from doing something that you know within yourself that you  
      are capable of doing, but it will paralyze you.  
	
	I won't talk abou it anymore.
